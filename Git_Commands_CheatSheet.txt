git log  ( to get the log status of all commits)
git log -p (One of the more helpful options is -p or --patch, which shows the difference (the patch output) introduced in each commit. You can also limit the number of log entries displayed, such as using -2 to show only the last two entries.)
git log --stat   (As you can see, the --stat option prints below each commit entry a list of modified files, how many files were changed, and how many lines in those files were added and removed. It also puts a summary of the information at the end.)

$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
